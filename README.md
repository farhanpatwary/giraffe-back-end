# Giraffe
This is the back end application for Giraffe, a reddit clone I am building using the MERN stack (MongoDB - Express.js - React.js - Node.js).  

If you want to try the deployed application click [Here](http://cool-giraffe.herokuapp.com/).   
**Note that the application is deployed on Heroku and may take up to a minute to load since the application closes after a period of inactivity.**
